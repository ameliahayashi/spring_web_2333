    <h1>This page will be a movie review of... Ballerina!</h1>
    <h2>Ballerina is in fact a very underated movie and probably one of my top 3 movies as of now.</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">There are a couple Ballerina movies but the one I'm talking about is directed by Lee Chung-hyun and stars Jeon Jong-seo, Kim Ji-hoon, and Park Yu-rim. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">I really loved ballerina and I would probably give it a 10/10</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Ballerina is rated R but trust me I watched it with my dad, my mom doesn't really like action movies.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Ballerina was really cool to me, the cinematography was so beautiful and the overall plot was really good.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">The 2023 South Korean action thriller film about an ex-bodyguard, Ok-Ju, who seeks revenge after her best friend, Min-hee, is found dead. Min-hee's last wish, left in a letter, is for Ok-Ju to avenge her by taking down the person responsible for her death. - from google</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">I really liked how it showed their backstory as friends and how you could see so much emotion throughout the movie.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">It all felt very real, I never felt bored, even after watching it 3 times, I still don't get bored.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">I think the main character was so inspiring and I really liked how powerful and confident she was.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">After she saved that girl and got revenge, I was so excited and happy for them all.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">I really like shoot 'em up and heavy action movies so this was perfect for me, especially as a girl myself I really love seeing strong female leads.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">It was also crazy when she took down an entire organization all by herself and it was overall a super satisfying watch.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves action, strong female main characters, and is mature enough for it. The one reason I wouldn't recommend it to everyone is because of it's basis around sex-trafficking, although it brings awareness to the disgustingness of it all it is also a heavy topic that could trigger things for different people.</p>
