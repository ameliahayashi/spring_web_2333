<h1 style="color:plum; text-align:center;">Hi! My name's Amelia</h1>

        <span id="index">This is a low-quality ai image of me.</span>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align:center;">I am currently 5'1" and 7/8's of an inch</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">I go to EPS</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">I have brown hair with red highlights that sometimes look purple</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">My zodiac sign is pisces(March not February or April), yes even after the scientists recalculated.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">My mbti is INFJ but I'm more of a ambivert</p>
    <p> style="text-align:center;"I usually will have 1 animal that I'm super obsessed with and want as a pet over a period of time for example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Doberman's</li>
        <li>Rottweiler's</li>
        <li>Ball pythons, specifically axanthic piebald's.</li>
        <li>bearded dragon's</li>
        <li>Oranda goldfish</li>
        <li>Chinchilla's</li>
        <li>Ragdoll's</li>
        <li>British shorthair's</li>
        <li>mini lop bunnie's</li>
        <li>guinea pig's</li>
        <li>and the list goes on...</li>
        <p>I don't really read that much but it's something I'd like to pick up!</p>
        <p>I have a lot of hobbie's and I've had to narrow down a lot over the 14 year's I've been alive for.</p>
        <p>I have a younger brohter, 1 mom, and 1 dad.</p>
        <p>I'm just a girl.</p>
        <p>I am half Japanese, half Italian, German, Czech, Irish, and a tiny bit Dutch.</p>
    </ul>
        <p>Here's a ordered list of the things I wanted to be when I was younger:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Veterinarian</li>
        <li>OBGYN(Obstetrics and gynaecology)</li>
        <li>CEO of a business except I didn't know what business exactly!</li>
    </ol>
            <p>My safe space would probably be my room</p>
        <p>I really want to get a lot more piercings on my ears including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 or 3 helix's</li>
            <li>a floating helix</li>
            <li>double piercings</li>
            <li>maybe a daith</li>
            <li>definitely a conch</li>
        </ul>
<p style="text-align:center;">unfortunately I can't get any more piercings now because of Judo!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Appearantly my seasonal color pallete is dark winter</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">My favorite metal is unplate white gold that looks more natural.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I am terribly afraid of spiders and I used to be afraid of heights but now I'm less afraid of heights</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I can do a cartwheel and the splits but only on my right side for both.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I really like flowers even though I'm allergic to pollen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I used to play tenis and golf when I was little, not competitively, and I was pretty good but I am really bad at both now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I am very emotional and 9 times out of 10 will cry during a sad movie</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I'm halfway through "A Man Called Otto" so don't spoil it!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I recently watched a movie for Catherine's birthday party called "Wolf Children" and it was probably one of the top 10 saddest movie's I've ever watched.</p>
