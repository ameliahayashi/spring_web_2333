    <p style="color:darkmagenta; text-align:center;">Petunia species are mostly annual herbs.</p>
    <p style="color:hotpink; text-align:center;">The leaves are sessile (e.g., lacking a petiole, or leaf stem) and are usually oval-shaped with smooth margins; some feature fine sticky hairs.</p>
    <p style="color:indigo; text-align:center;">The flowers are funnel-shaped, consisting of five fused or partially fused petals and five green sepals.</p>
    <p style="color:violet; text-align:center;">Most species are insect-pollinated, though P. exserta is pollinated by hummingbirds.</p>
    <p style="color:pink; text-align:center;">Although technically a perennial, the common garden petunia is most often grown as an annual; its flowers bloom profusely from early summer until frost.</p>
    <p style="color:lightpink; text-align:center;">The plant grows well in temperate climates and does not tolerate shade.</p>
    <p style="color:violet; text-align:center;">The innumerable horticultural varieties fall into two general types:</p>
        <li style="color:mediumvioletred; text-align:center;">The compact erect type, reaching 15–25 cm (6–10 inches) and adapted for summer garden beds.</li>
        <li style="color:plum; text-align:center;">And the sprawling long-stemmed balcony petunia, which grows to about 46 cm (18 inches) and is often potted in hanging baskets and window boxes.</li>
    <p style="color:magenta; text-align: center;">The flowers range from pure white to deep crimson or purple and are often speckled or veined in contrasting colors.</p>
    <p style="color:fuchsia; text-align: center;">There are single- and double-bloom varieties as well!</p>
    <p style="color:hotpink; text-align:center;">Gardening can be considered both as an art, concerned with arranging plants harmoniously in their surroundings, and as a science, encompassing the principles and techniques of plant cultivation.</p>
    <p style="color:palevioletred; text-align:center;">The basic principles involved in growing plants are the same in all parts of the world.</p>
